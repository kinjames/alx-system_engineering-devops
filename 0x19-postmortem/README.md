# Web Stack Outage Incident Postmortem

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: June 5, 2023, 10:00 AM to June 6, 2023, 2:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact**: The service "ABC Web Application" experienced intermittent downtime and severe performance degradation, affecting approximately 75% of users. Users reported slow page load times, frequent timeouts, and difficulty accessing critical features.

## Timeline
- **10:00 AM**: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a high number of HTTP 500 errors.
- **Actions taken**: Investigated the application servers, load balancers, and database servers to identify potential causes of the issue. Assumption: The issue might be related to a misconfiguration in the load balancing layer.
- **Misleading investigation paths**: Initially focused on load balancer configurations and explored potential network issues.
- **11:30 AM**: No conclusive evidence found, escalated the incident to the network operations team for further investigation.
- **Actions taken**: Network operations team reviewed the load balancer configurations and network logs.
- **Misleading investigation paths**: Network operations team suspected a network issue between the load balancers and the application servers.
- **2:00 PM**: No network issues found, escalated the incident to the development team.
- **Actions taken**: Development team reviewed application logs, codebase, and performed database performance analysis.
- **Misleading investigation paths**: Development team suspected a database bottleneck due to increased query load.
- **6:00 PM**: No significant findings, escalated the incident to the infrastructure team.
- **Actions taken**: Infrastructure team conducted a thorough analysis of server resource utilization, disk I/O, and memory usage.
- **Misleading investigation paths**: Infrastructure team focused on server performance but overlooked the application layer.
- **10:00 PM**: Identified that the issue originated from an inefficient API call in the application code.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root cause**: An API call to an external service was made synchronously, causing a delay in processing requests and leading to performance degradation and occasional timeouts.
- **Resolution**: The application code was refactored to make the API call asynchronously, improving response times and eliminating the performance bottleneck.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- Improve monitoring capabilities to proactively detect performance issues and errors.
- Implement a code review process to identify and address potential performance issues and inefficient API calls.
- Conduct regular load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify any performance bottlenecks before they impact users.
- Document best practices for asynchronous API calls and encourage their adoption throughout the codebase.
- Provide incident response training to improve coordination and minimize investigation time during future incidents.

## Tasks
- Patch application code to refactor synchronous API calls to asynchronous calls.
- Enhance monitoring system to alert on high error rates and slow response times.
- Implement regular load testing procedures to identify performance issues.
- Document best practices for efficient API calls and share with the development team.
- Conduct incident response training sessions for all relevant teams.

By conducting a thorough investigation and addressing the root cause, we have resolved the web stack outage incident. We have also outlined corrective measures to prevent similar issues in the future, ensuring a more robust and reliable service for our users.
